How stuck in monotony we are
Until these humdrum doldrums are
Dead and gone and all there is is song
Streaming through like a river of solid playful ecstasy

Poetry means filtering through the ten thousand things and finding
What is beautiful
What comes from the heart
And washes like a tidal wave over all our tiny lives
