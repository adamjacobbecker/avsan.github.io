flashes like thunder pour like tea over an infusion of understanding  
fragments don't need to be put together, back together what gether?  
going with not knowing what is going on turns into a song of life  
and living  
giving birth to vitality itself, what is there here, everywhere?  
really now, what is nothing when we stare it down and frown?  
every clarity springs unbidden from the nowhere it is  
and every perpetual momentary silence in our hearts births new worlds  
as unsilent as lightening  

sitting in silly rooms forever waiting for  
something to end and something to begin  
talking about talking about words  
words about words, brains pushed up against themselves  
what a mess of thinking about  
wandering about thinking what springs out?
