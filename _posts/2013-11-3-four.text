Slowly sing with me my dear
Let our fears fade, absences
Are everything but fullness
Fades too into sentences
Beloved beauty, smoothness
Grown from emptiness inside
Set stark against nothing there
Where only love abides and
Stare into her eyes and smile
Finding wisdom in your heart
And peace in your mind
