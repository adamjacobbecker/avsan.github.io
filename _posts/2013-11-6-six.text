Tarry long here my darling and a storm of emotion
Will swirl through your heart like a torrent of freshly living
And the endless parade of separation will dim down
For
This glowing silent transience that is our lives
Rises and falls erratic like a moonless tide
But what I am is poetry and
The spiraling pinnacles of interfused ecstasy
That you and I, my love
Together rise to.
