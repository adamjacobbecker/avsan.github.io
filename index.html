  <p>Hi, I'm Aviv. I just graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Comparative Literature and am currently looking for work in the technology sector in Boulder, CO, where I will be moving in August. I have a good working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and Swift (I can also read and <a href='http://bit.ly/avivsthesis'>write</a> quite well), and I'm a very quick, motivated, and eager learner. Despite my degree in the humanities, I've been programming since age 12 (my dad is a software engineer) and am currently the webmaster for the <a href='http://uhs.berkeley.edu'>University Health Services</a> at Berkeley (such as it is). I'm currently working on a <a href='projects/nsbus.html'>Nextbus client</a> for iOS written in Swift, but I'm generally interested in a wide variety of software topics, including NLP, documentation, interface design, mobile development, database APIs, and web app development. Also, when I was in middle school I wrote a dashboard <a href='http://www.dashboardwidgets.com/showcase/details.php?wid=486'>widget</a> that was on Apple's top 10 downloads list <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20050618023735/http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/'>for</a> <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20050809010700/http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/'>over</a> 7 weeks, <i><a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20050706015443/http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/'>peaking at #3</a></i>.</p>
  <p>If you're interested in hiring me, here's my <a href='i/resume.pdf'>resume</a>.</p>
